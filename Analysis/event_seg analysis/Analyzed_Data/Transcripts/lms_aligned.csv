1.058,1.899, You heard what I said?
1.919,4.08,Did it go in anywhere?
4.1,5.902,"Yeah, I think we get the point, Dad."
6.142,7.103,Don't show me the pad.
7.123,8.524,I don't want to see the fucking pad.
8.884,11.266,"Mom, how much can we spend?"
11.486,13.347,I would say $4.
13.387,14.088,Anything under $4.
18.578,18.858, Hi.
19.479,19.819,You ready?
20.159,23.721,"Yeah, I'm gonna have the, uh, number five with coffee, please."
24.342,24.682,All right.
25.102,28.124,"And, uh, number seven, over easy, and, uh, grapefruit juice."
28.364,28.865,Grapefruit?
29.365,33.447,"Um, I would like a fruit plate, and, uh, do you have chamomile?"
33.567,33.708,Yes.
34.168,34.848,"With honey, please."
35.289,38.751,I would like the lumberjack and coffee and extra bacon.
39.371,39.691,Extra?
40.452,42.073,"No, Dad, you should probably... Richard, don't start."
42.093,43.674,He's gonna kill himself.
43.694,44.474,"Well, it's his life."
44.875,45.615,"Thank you, Cheryl."
46.135,46.896,"Uh, garden salad?"
48.263,48.583, And you.
49.403,50.204,I'm sorry.
50.324,51.404,I'm sorry.
51.484,51.964,Take your time.
52.344,52.984,Don't apologize.
53.064,54.145,It's a sign of weakness.
55.345,57.266,"Um, well, I want... Okay, okay."
57.326,58.106,I know what I want.
58.166,58.386,I know.
58.606,58.866,Okay.
59.306,65.008,"Can I get the waffles and, um... What does alamode mean?"
65.208,66.468,"Oh, that means it comes with ice cream."
66.748,66.988,Okay.
67.249,67.629,Alamode.
68.389,69.309,Olive for breakfast.
70.67,71.87,Set for dollars.
72.49,72.93,Okay.
72.99,73.45,You're right.
73.47,73.89,Okay.
73.93,74.951,Be right back.
76.573,82.876," Actually, Olive, a la mode in French translates literally as in the fashion."
83.777,84.838,A la mode.
85.598,89.46,"Mode is derived from the Latin modus, meaning do our proper measure."
89.48,89.96,"Frank, shut up."
89.98,90.22,Richard.
90.26,93.082,"Olive, can I tell you a little something about ice cream?"
94.083,101.246,"Well, ice cream is made from cream, which comes from cow's milk, and cream has a lot of fat in it."
101.567,101.887,Richard.
103.038,103.198, What?
103.218,105.058,"She's going to find out anyway, remember?"
105.438,105.659,What?
106.159,106.839,Find out what?
107.119,111.72,"Well, when you eat ice cream, the fat in the ice cream becomes fat in your body."
111.76,112.8,"Richard, I swear to God."
112.88,113.38,It's true.
113.72,113.98,What?
114.02,114.68,What's wrong?
115.16,115.74,Nothing's wrong.
116.121,123.662,"So, if you eat a lot of ice cream, you might become fat, and if you don't, you're going to stay nice and skinny, sweetie."
125.202,126.403,"Olive, Richard is an idiot."
126.683,128.343,I like a woman with meat on her bones.
130.007,131.208, Why is everyone so upset?
131.248,132.408,"No, no one's upset, honey."
132.508,135.709,I just want you to understand.
135.909,139.05,"It's okay to be skinny, and it's okay to be fat if that's what you want to be."
139.35,141.13,"Whatever you want, it's okay."
142.39,144.211,"Okay, but let me ask you this."
145.391,151.933,"Those women in Miss America, are they skinny or are they fat?"
153.893,154.173,Honey?
155.274,155.354,No.
158.413,159.413," They're skinny, I guess."
159.653,159.954,Yeah.
160.534,162.014,I guess they don't eat a lot of ice cream.
162.214,162.795,Okay.
163.175,163.555,Coffee?
164.495,166.176,Coffee?
167.836,168.377,Grapefruit?
168.817,169.397,Thank you.
170.017,170.617,Chamomile?
172.258,173.639,And here's your ice cream.
173.859,174.579,"A la Modi, right?"
175.379,176.66,I'll be back with your waffles in a sec.
180.741,182.242,Does anyone want my ice cream?
183.598,184.799," Yeah, I'd like a little."
185.219,187.92,"Dwayne, Frank, Olive's not going to have her ice cream."
187.94,189.401,"Yeah, do you mind if I have a little bit?"
189.421,190.161,"Yeah, let's dig in."
190.201,191.462,That looks really good.
191.582,195.924,"Boy, I feel sorry for anybody that doesn't want to enjoy their ice cream so early in the morning."
196.004,197.205,"Oh, that looks good."
197.265,199.186,"You sure you don't want to have some, Olive?"
199.286,201.687,Those waffles are going to be awful lonely in there.
201.747,203.688,Watch this.
204.128,204.869,Wait!
205.009,205.329,Stop!
205.729,206.69,Don't eat it all.
206.71,212.893,"All right, Olive."
212.913,213.173,Richard.
218.285,220.888," Hey, Stan!"
221.128,227.416,"Stan, it's Mr. Again, listen, I know you're busy, but we're just dying to hear what numbers you came up with in Scottsdale."
227.436,228.937,"So give me a call, please."
230.439,231.0,"Hey, did you get him?"
231.02,233.102,"No, I can't get a signal out."
236.54,237.72, How long till we get there?
237.74,238.441,"Long time, honey."
238.461,240.321,"I know, but how long?"
240.541,243.862,"Well, we got to do 600 miles of driving today and 200 tomorrow."
243.882,245.083,It's a lot of driving.
245.103,245.403,Let's go.
245.423,246.783,"Well, honey, I'll drive for a while."
247.183,247.843,"No, no, I got it."
247.923,248.764,"No, you're right."
248.784,249.884,I got to learn how to do this.
249.964,250.744,"I mean, you're doing it."
250.804,251.624,How hard can it be?
255.325,256.566,Push the stick down hard.
256.606,257.526,I'm pushing hard.
258.326,260.447,"Okay, okay, there you go."
260.467,262.908,Now put the clutch in all the way to the floor.
262.928,263.728,It's on the floor.
266.671,274.157, Stick him on there.
274.457,277.22,Push down hard.
282.584,284.426,"Well, you got a problem."
285.567,287.529,"Your clutch is, uh, shut."
288.67,289.69,Can we get a new one?
290.571,293.514,"These old buses, you have to order the part."
294.4,295.08, How long did it take?
295.841,297.562,"Well, uh, it's the weekend."
298.563,303.146,So... maybe... Thursday?
309.59,321.318,"Is there a, uh... dealership around here?"
323.069,325.43," Well, they're probably going to be close."
325.45,327.071,"It's the weekend, you know."
327.451,328.492,"Yes, we're aware of that."
330.853,331.433,I'll tell you what.
332.054,333.454,You know these old buses?
334.195,338.477,You don't need the clutch to change from the third to the fourth.
338.997,342.559,You only really need the clutch to go from number one to number two.
343.519,352.544,"But as long as you keep parking on a hill and you let it go, and it goes 15, 20 miles per hour, you start it on third, and then you go from third to fourth."
354.079,355.06, What if you're not on a hill?
355.48,356.22,There's no hill.
356.44,357.121,What if there's no hill?
357.161,360.823,What do you think?
365.645,367.486,There is.
367.606,369.548,"Dad, I want you in the car first."
370.068,371.028,"I know, we know."
371.048,371.949,"All right, here we go."
374.67,375.511,Everybody push!
384.676,385.056, Okay.
385.376,390.619,I just want everyone here to know that I am the preeminent true scholar in the United States.
390.659,393.1,"Come on, honey."
393.14,394.14,I'm putting it in gear.
395.581,396.221,"Go, honey."
396.322,397.002,Come on.
397.022,397.602,Come on.
397.662,398.222,Come on.
398.302,398.923,Come on.
398.943,399.263,Come on.
399.283,399.703,Come on.
399.743,400.043,Come on.
400.063,400.483,Come on.
400.523,401.244,Come on.
404.886,407.187,Come on.
407.467,408.787,Come on.
408.807,409.068,Come on.
412.413,414.155," Come on, come on, come on, you dumb bastard."
414.695,416.436,"I can't, I can't slow down."
416.536,418.198,I can't slow down.
418.218,418.638,Let's go.
418.658,419.038,Come on.
421.04,423.782,"Come on, come on, get in."
425.563,426.884,No one gets left behind.
427.064,428.185,No one gets left behind.
428.205,430.387,"Outstanding, soldier, outstanding."
430.407,437.713,Outstanding.
439.174,439.734,Was that fun?
489.242,492.869," Finally, I'm just sitting there, and I decide, you know, this is Stan Grossman."
492.949,493.49,What the hell?
493.971,499.721,"And I start pitching him the nine steps, and about, I don't know, two minutes in, he stops me, he says..."
501.167,502.207, I can sell this.
503.168,503.628,Interesting.
504.668,506.528,"Yeah, and this is the guy who knows how to do it, you know?"
506.568,511.81,"You start with a book, and then you do a media tour, corporate events, DVD, VHS series."
511.85,515.191,"I mean, there's a whole fascinating science into how you roll these things out."
515.691,515.911,Wow.
516.191,521.592,"Yeah, so he's in Scottsdale right now, you know, building the buzz and kind of getting the whole hype thing going."
521.852,525.193,He's doing what the pros call a ticking clock auction.
526.193,527.834,"Oh, how about that?"
531.914,535.335," Yeah, and I can detect that note of sarcasm there, Frank."
535.675,536.875,What sarcasm?
536.935,537.916,I didn't hear it.
538.196,539.356,But I want you to know something.
540.937,541.857,I feel sorry for you.
542.677,543.097,You do?
543.217,543.557,Good.
543.997,544.498,"Yeah, I do."
544.518,546.998,Because sarcasm is the refuge of losers.
547.658,548.039,It is?
548.259,548.739,Really?
548.939,549.099,Yep.
550.074,554.315," Sarcasm is losers trying to bring winners down to their level, and that's step four in the program."
554.375,556.715,"Wow, Richard, you really opened my eyes to what a loser I am."
556.835,558.535,How much do I owe you for those pearls?
558.615,559.816,"Oh, that one's on the house, buddy."
559.856,560.096,It is?
560.136,561.176,"Yeah, it's on the house."
561.196,561.996,That's on the house.
562.076,562.656,Wow.
563.056,564.797,That was for free.
564.837,565.617,No charge.
565.657,566.317,No charge.
566.377,566.757,Stop it.
566.797,567.777,He started it.
568.317,568.997,"Oh, wait a second."
569.017,569.837,"Hey, hey, hey, quiet."
569.857,570.278,This is it.
570.298,571.138,This is that call.
573.638,573.818,Hello?
573.858,573.938,Stan?
575.578,575.818,Stan?
586.997,587.677, Stan Grossman.
588.678,589.298,Richard Hoover.
590.479,591.059,Finally.
591.799,592.46,How you doing?
593.2,593.64,"No, I know."
593.66,596.022,We were on the highway and I lost you and myself.
596.062,596.622,Forget about it.
596.662,597.182,How'd we do?
604.346,605.546,"Honey, I'm going to use the ladies' room."
605.586,606.127,You need to go?
606.807,609.408,"No, I'm going to go practice my routine over there."
609.849,611.249,"Okay, well, don't go too far."
612.41,614.251,"Well, I think we just got to talk to him a little..."
616.018,616.739," No, you gotta talk."
617.96,619.041,"No, Stan, listen to me."
619.321,619.922,Hold on now.
620.543,621.624,I am going to get something to drink.
621.644,622.245,You want anything?
622.265,624.447,"Uh, yeah."
624.807,625.748,Get me some porn.
626.589,627.03,Okay.
627.57,628.992,"Get me something really nasty, too."
629.012,630.453,I don't want any of that airbrush shit.
630.814,631.114,Okay.
631.374,632.355,"Okay, here's a 20."
632.395,633.657,"Get yourself a little treat, too."
633.737,635.599,Get yourself a fag rag.
636.399,637.441,"All right, I will."
640.613,640.933, That one.
641.874,642.134,Yes.
642.354,642.894,And that one.
644.174,645.655,And I would like that one.
645.715,646.215,"No, down."
646.715,646.955,Yes.
647.736,647.956,Yes.
648.336,648.576,Yes.
648.676,649.416,I would like that one.
650.197,655.018,And I will have a blue raspberry slushie.
656.439,656.839,Frank?
658.479,659.24,"Oh, my God."
659.3,659.76,How are you?
