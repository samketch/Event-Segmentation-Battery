4.794,6.596, Man missing on Tier 2 cell 245.
6.656,7.377,Dufresne!
7.397,10.26,"Get your ass out here, boy."
10.3,11.461,You're holding up the show.
14.925,17.928,Don't make me come down there or I'll thump your skull for you.
25.435,27.056," Dammit, new friend, you're putting me behind."
27.596,28.637,I got a schedule to keep.
29.237,31.639,"You better be sick or dead in there, I shit you not."
32.499,33.32,You hear me?
40.084,41.145,"Oh, my holy God."
58.226,59.747, Every man on this cell block questioned.
60.968,62.069,Start with that friend of his.
62.33,62.57,Who?
63.571,63.891,Him.
65.832,66.453,Open 237.
70.677,72.498,What do you mean he just wasn't here?
73.359,74.3,"Don't say that to me, Haig."
75.16,76.261,Don't say that to me again.
76.582,77.302,"But, sir, he wasn't."
77.783,78.763,"I can see that, Haig."
79.584,80.345,Think I'm blind?
81.686,82.426,Is that what you're saying?
83.507,84.368,"Am I blind, Haig?"
84.788,85.149,"No, sir."
86.852,87.372, What about you?
87.893,88.353,You blind?
88.373,90.434,Tell me what this is.
90.774,91.515,Last night's camp.
91.535,91.815,Mm-hmm.
92.275,93.516,You see Dufresne's name there?
93.976,94.597,I sure do.
94.617,95.337,"See, right there."
95.617,96.238,Dufresne.
98.599,100.28,He was in his cell at lights out.
101.04,102.881,Stands a reason he'd still be here in the morning.
104.522,105.363,I want him found.
106.223,108.405,"Not tomorrow, not after breakfast."
108.845,109.165,Now!
109.686,110.066,"Yes, sir."
124.036,124.436," Well, what?"
125.196,126.457,I see you two all the time.
126.497,127.717,"You're thick as thieves, you are."
129.518,130.718,He must have said something.
131.659,133.94,"Also, Warden, not a word."
136.3,137.901,"Lord, it's a miracle!"
139.261,141.122,Man up and vanished like a fart in the wind.
142.322,146.064,Nothing left but some damn rocks on a windowsill.
147.082,148.383, And that cupcake on the wall?
148.944,149.604,Let's ask her.
149.965,150.826,Maybe she knows.
150.886,152.367,"What say you there, fussy britches?"
152.868,153.608,Feel like talking?
155.07,156.371,"Ah, guess not."
157.552,158.793,Why should she be any different?
160.835,161.956,This is a conspiracy.
162.877,163.778,That's what this is.
165.339,168.562,One big damn conspiracy!
169.083,170.064,And everyone's in on it!
206.432,211.293," In 1966, Andy Dufresne escaped from Shawshank prison."
214.194,222.276,"All they found of him was a muddy set of prison clothes, a bar of soap, and an old rock hammer, damn near worn down to the nub."
227.397,231.338,I remember thinking it would take a man 600 years to tunnel through the wall with it.
232.558,233.819,Old Andy did it in less than 20.
252.637,254.078," Oh, Andy loved geology."
255.54,257.722,I imagine it appealed to his meticulous nature.
257.742,262.786,"An ice age here, million years of mountain building there."
264.528,266.549,Geology is the study of pressure and time.
268.131,269.252,"That's all it takes, really."
270.653,272.815,Pressure and time.
274.815,276.356, That and a big goddamn poster.
280.618,285.141,"Like I said, in prison, a man will do most anything to keep his mind occupied."
288.583,292.766,"Turns out, Andy's favorite hobby was toting his wall out into the exercise yard."
293.686,294.727,A handful at a time.
296.888,301.471,"I guess after Tommy was killed, Andy decided he'd been here just about long enough."
301.491,303.472,"Split, wanna get home?"
305.214,307.456," Just about finished, sir."
307.516,313.78,Three deposits tonight.
336.63,337.891, And he did like he was told.
338.971,341.632,Buffed those shoes to a high mirror shine.
345.854,347.235,The guard simply didn't notice.
347.255,353.798,"Neither did I. I mean, seriously, how often do you really look at a man's shoes?"
