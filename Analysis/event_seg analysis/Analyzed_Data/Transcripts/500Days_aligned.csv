0.029,2.211, Things you can't explain away.
2.231,5.134,But my heart aches every day.

8.236,8.436,Go.
8.456,9.317,Let's fight.
9.437,10.558,I'll see you.
10.698,11.859,Waste of time.
11.98,16.824,You don't look anything like yourself.
17.064,21.588,Now departing on track two.
21.628,23.55,This is an extra flight.
23.75,25.471,Welcome to the stand by.
35.12,35.581," Hey, baby."
35.681,36.181,"Hey, you here?"
36.942,37.282,Hell no.
37.302,38.844,"What do you mean, hell no?"
38.864,39.705,I'm not going to that.
40.145,40.726,"Yes, you are."
40.746,43.108,"No, man, it's going to be all old people."
43.388,44.61,"Yeah, but you said you were going."
44.63,45.33,That's why I'm going.
45.711,48.373,"And that's why I called her last night, told her I was sick."
48.674,49.414,Like a ninja.
49.735,51.797,I'm not going to know anybody at this thing.
51.837,53.879,Maybe you'll meet some hot granddaughters or something.
54.279,54.86,I'm hanging up now.
55.12,55.601,"Bye, baby."
59.3,62.572, The passenger is boarding a train in Los Angeles this week.
62.632,65.262,Passengers to Quintana are ready for delay.
94.955,95.455," Hi, Tom."
96.556,97.816,"Hey, Summer."
98.977,100.217,I must have walked right by you.
101.158,101.598,Yeah.
103.119,104.239,"Well, what are you doing?"
104.459,105.18,Are you going to Millie's?
107.721,108.161,Me too.
108.181,109.502,Cool.
109.762,110.442,I forgot you knew her.
111.383,111.723,Yeah.
112.363,113.624,We worked together all that time.
114.024,114.384,Of course.
114.644,115.204,I love Millie.
115.224,116.025,She's the sweetest.
117.345,117.685,She is.
118.806,119.386,How are you?
120.107,120.287,Good.
120.647,121.127,Good.
121.267,121.867,I wrote to you.
121.907,122.648,I never heard back.
123.365,124.846," Yeah, yeah, sorry about that."
124.946,126.566,"I just, you know, it got kind of crazy."
127.107,129.828,"The holidays came up, so work was... You still working for Vance?"
131.329,131.529,Yeah.
132.309,141.653,"Well, I was going to go get a coffee if you want to... Architecture of Happiness."
141.813,142.093,Yes.
142.113,143.754,That looks like a good book.
146.976,147.796,"Well, I don't want to bother you."
147.956,151.558,"No, no, I, um... Yeah, let's get coffee."
153.101,155.285, I have to go.
191.211,195.194, You look nice.
195.254,195.554,Nice.
196.314,197.935,So do you.
198.496,207.381,Well... Penis.
210.463,210.663,No.
212.184,214.025,I now pronounce you husband and wife.
214.866,215.766,You may kiss the bride.
226.994,231.699," Okay, what else you got?"
233.06,235.803,"Well, you snore."
236.403,237.344,"No, I don't."
237.564,238.085,You do.
238.105,238.946,"No, I don't."
239.066,239.806,Yeah.
240.227,241.228,"Well, you do too."
241.248,242.769,"Oh, I definitely do."
243.13,244.131,And your feet reek.
244.967,245.828, That one time.
246.188,246.788,Every time.
246.828,247.809,That one time.
248.149,250.79,"No, that one time especially, but every time."
251.09,254.112,"And when you wake up, your hair sticks up like that."
255.172,255.973,It's ridiculous.
256.013,256.893,You're ridiculous.
256.933,258.594,Your favorite beetle is Ringo.
259.054,259.795,Damn right.
259.955,262.116,Ringo's the best.
262.496,266.498,Ringo is... He's fast!
266.878,267.359,He's fast!
267.419,267.679,Damn!
267.919,268.939,All right.
270.4,270.78,You got me.
271.821,272.121,Duck.
273.362,273.622,Duck.
298.946,320.653," Hey, I was wondering, um, I was gonna maybe have a party on Friday, um, on our rooftop that has, like, a really nice garden."
320.693,321.473,Do you want to come?
322.853,323.093,Yeah.
323.333,325.374,If you're not busy.
328.312,329.284, I don't think I will be.
364.312,365.313, I guess I just got lucky.
366.974,368.115,We met in elementary school.
368.635,374.239,"In seventh grade, we had the same class schedule, and we just clicked."
375.52,375.801,You know?
376.841,377.202,Love?
378.443,379.203,"Shit, I don't know."
380.264,382.245,"As long as she's cute and she's willing, right?"
383.666,387.73,"I'm flexible on the cute, so... 21 years."
389.631,390.772,She's the light that guides me home.
392.714,394.214," Yes, that is from one of our cards."
395.755,396.815,"No, someone else wrote it."
397.716,398.596,Doesn't make it less true.
399.876,409.019,"I think technically the girl of my dreams would probably have, like, a really bodacious rack, you know, maybe different hair."
409.679,411.44,"You know, she'd probably be a little more into sports."
411.72,417.681,"But, um, truthfully, Robin's better than the girl of my dreams."
419.022,419.442,She's real.
441.615,446.098," Tom walked to her apartment, intoxicated by the promise of the evening."
446.978,451.901,"He believed that this time, his expectations would align with reality."
468.504,469.445, Nice.
469.505,469.905,Your tie.
469.965,470.746,How you doing?
470.786,472.067,"Good, how are you?"
472.107,472.628,Good.
472.768,474.71,"I, um... Oh, nice."
495.041,495.662, Thank you.
496.322,498.023,You shouldn't have.
498.043,500.965,That's so nice.
501.005,502.827,Thank you so much.
502.887,506.529,I'm excited to read it.
507.13,508.471,"So, Tom, what is it that you do?"
508.811,510.892,I write greeting cards.
511.233,513.354,Tom could be a really great architect if he wanted to be.
514.555,515.295,That's unusual.
515.356,517.777,"I mean, what made you go from one to the other?"
518.338,524.342,"I guess I just figured, why make something disposable like a building when you can make something that lasts forever?"
525.314,528.516, No one's got it all.
528.536,529.837,No one's got it all.
551.241,552.742, We're not doing any meeting.
552.842,556.803,"We're trying to be faithful, but we're cheating, cheating, cheating."
569.569,573.352," I'm the hero of the story, don't need to be saved."
573.872,577.695,"I'm the hero of the story, don't need to be saved."
577.715,582.099,"I'm the hero of the story, don't need to be saved."
582.619,586.642,"I'm the hero of the story, don't need to be saved."
586.782,588.103,It's all right.
588.203,588.744,It's all right.
588.784,589.644,It's all right.
589.664,591.746,It's all right.
591.786,592.367,It's all right.
592.467,594.969,It's all right.
595.109,596.109,It's all right.
596.189,598.231,It's all right.
609.77,609.974, got it all
639.784,647.674, just trying to swing a full-time right i never knew the cold had the danger
