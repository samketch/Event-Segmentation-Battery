8.863,12.507," Laura, at this stage I can offer nothing more than my word."
13.928,16.851,I am a senior government employee in the intelligence community.
17.832,24.318,"I hope you understand that contacting you is extremely high risk, and you are willing to agree to the following precautions before I share more."
25.639,27.02,This will not be a waste of your time.
28.862,32.826,"The following sounds complex, but should only take minutes to complete for someone technical."
34.164,39.528, I would like to confirm out of email that the keys we exchanged were not intercepted and replaced by your surveillance.
41.609,46.452,Please confirm that no one has ever had a copy of your private key and that it uses a strong passphrase.
47.012,50.275,Assume your adversary is capable of one trillion guesses per second.
51.776,58.5,"If the device you store the private key and enter your passphrase on has been hacked, it is trivial to decrypt our communications."
60.16,64.563," Understand that the above steps are not bulletproof, and are intended only to give us breathing room."
65.104,68.846,"In the end, if you publish the source material, I will likely be immediately implicated."
69.467,72.529,This must not deter you from releasing the information I will provide.
74.61,75.951,"Thank you, and be careful."
77.673,78.053,Citizen 4
100.731,107.973," By the way, does surveillance mean that there are facts for the law to apply to?"
107.993,112.574,"If you take away the surveillance, there are no facts that the government can manufacture."
112.634,113.174,That's right.
113.354,115.475,And this is all about creating an independent record.
115.535,122.937,"To me, this goes to the question of independently verifying what the government is doing."
123.177,124.578," Hey, can you hear me?"
124.598,125.838,"I am here, David."
126.098,127.219,How are you?
148.206,156.811," Well, I would just start by pointing to what Barack Obama himself said about those questions when he was running for the office that he now occupies in December of 2007."
157.352,168.098,"He said, quote, the president does not have the power under the Constitution to unilaterally authorize a military attack in a situation that does not involve stopping an actual or imminent threat to the nation."
168.178,173.542,"So by Obama's own words, the president does not have the power that he's now exercising under the Constitution"
174.062,188.266," And as far as why it matters, on August 1, 2007, when he laid out his reasons why he was running for office and why he thought it was so important to change the way we were doing things, he said, quote, no more ignoring the law when it's inconvenient."
188.326,189.586,That is not who we are.
189.986,195.288,We will again set an example for the world that the law is not subject to the whims of stubborn rulers.
195.748,199.349,So to allow presidents to simply start wars on their own without anything...
224.298,225.52, You asked why I picked you.
227.003,227.424,I didn't.
228.045,228.426,You did.
229.588,231.952,The surveillance you've experienced means you've been selected.
232.794,236.782,A term which will mean more to you as you learn about how the modern SIGINT system works.
239.085,257.332," For now, know that every border you cross, every purchase you make, every call you dial, every cell phone tower you pass, friend you keep, article you write, site you visit, subject line you type, and packet you route is in the hands of a system whose reach is unlimited but whose safeguards are not."
259.329,266.344," Your victimization by the NSA system means that you are well aware of the threat that unrestricted, secret police pose for democracies."
267.507,269.27,This is a story few but you can tell.
287.639,287.699," So,"
324.418,329.941, Thank you for inviting me here to give me the opportunity to express my story.
330.361,331.962,But let me give you some of my background.
332.782,336.024,I spent about four years in the military and then I went into NSA directly.
337.608,341.411, So I ended up with about 37 years of service combined.
341.931,343.592,"Most of it was a lot of fun, I tell you."
343.612,347.915,"It was really a lot of fun breaking these puzzles, you know, solving problems and things like that."
348.356,349.396,And that's really what I did.
349.416,353.959,"I fundamentally started working out with data, looking at data and data systems and how you do that."
354.24,363.846,"I was developing this concept of analysis that you could lay it out in such a way that it could be coded and executed electronically, meaning you could automate analysis."
365.034,367.976, And it has to do with metadata and using metadata relationships.
368.696,371.718,So that was my whole theme there at NSA.
371.838,373.258,"Eventually, that's what I ended up doing."
373.299,375.2,"I was the only one there doing that, by the way."
376.24,390.468,"So at any rate, 9-11 happened, and it must have been right after a few days, no more than a week after 9-11, that they had decided to begin actively spying on everyone in this country."
391.311,395.714, And they wanted the back part of our program to run all the spying.
396.714,398.575,All right?
398.595,400.056,So that's exactly what they did.
400.836,404.278,And then they started taking the telecom data and then expanded after that.
404.518,410.762,"So, I mean, the one I knew was AT&T, and that one provided 320 million records every day."
412.003,419.147,"That program was reauthorized every 45 days by what I call the Yes Committee, which was Hayden and Tennant and..."
420.41,423.692," the DOJ, the program was called Stellar Wind."
424.593,432.479,"So first I went to the House Intelligence Committee and the staff member that I personally knew there, and she then went to the chairman of that committee."
432.879,434.641,Nancy Pelosi was the minority rep.
436.422,439.044,"They were all briefed into the program at the time, by the way."
439.919,443.62," and all the other programs that were going on, including all these CIA programs."
444.46,445.32,I wasn't alone in this.
445.34,457.643,"There were four others out of NSA, and we were all trying to work internally in the government over these years, trying to get them to come around to being constitutionally acceptable and take it into the courts and have the courts' oversight of it, too."
458.403,464.524,"So we naively kept thinking that that could happen, and it never did."
466.394,473.241," But at any rate, after that and all the stuff we were doing, they decided to raid us to keep us quiet, threaten us."
473.942,476.685,"So we were raided simultaneously, four of us."
477.145,478.887,"In my case, they came in with guns drawn."
478.947,480.569,"I don't know why they did that, but they did."
501.522,505.904," Laura, I will answer what I remember of your questions as best I can."
506.424,507.645,Forgive the lack of structure.
507.865,510.786,I am not a writer and I have to draft this in a great hurry.
512.927,515.128,What you know as Stellar Wind has grown.
516.568,527.213,"SSO, the expanded special source operations that took over Stellar Wind's share of the pie, has spread all over the world to practically include comprehensive coverage of the United States."
528.635,530.716," Disturbingly, the amount of U.S."
530.756,533.877,communication ingested by NSA is still increasing.
535.158,539.96,"Publicly, we complain that things are going dark, but in fact our accesses are improving."
541.04,545.522,The truth is that the NSA has never in its history collected more than it does now.
548.424,554.646,I know the location of most domestic interception points and that the largest telecommunication companies in the U.S.
554.887,557.948,"are betraying the trust of their customers, which I can prove."
559.551,566.079," We are building the greatest weapon for oppression in the history of man, yet its directors exempt themselves from accountability."
568.101,572.206,"NSA Director Keith Alexander lied to Congress, which I can prove."
573.929,574.91,Billions of U.S.
574.93,576.612,communications are being intercepted.
578.666,582.67," In gathering evidence of wrongdoing, I focused on the wronging of the American people."
582.871,588.797,But believe me when I say that the surveillance we live under is the highest privilege compared to how we treat the rest of the world.
590.079,591.08,This I can also prove.
593.248,598.11," On cyber operations, the government's public position is that we still lack a policy framework."
598.51,599.47,"This, too, is a lie."
599.91,605.833,"There is a detailed policy framework, a kind of martial law for cyber operations created by the White House."
606.473,610.674,It's called Presidential Policy Directive 20 and was finalized at the end of last year.
611.715,612.755,This I can also prove.
614.536,620.258,"I appreciate your concern for my safety, but I already know how this will end for me, and I accept the risk."
621.508,625.312," If I have luck, and you are careful, you will have everything you need."
626.133,630.118,I ask only that you ensure this information makes it home to the American public.
631.84,636.185,Does the NSA routinely intercept American citizens' emails?
637.026,637.146,No.
639.414,645.157, Does the NSA intercept Americans' cell phone conversations?
645.458,645.698,No.
646.518,647.379,Google searches?
648.219,648.459,No.
649.1,650.04,Text messages?
650.641,650.881,No.
651.561,653.262,Amazon.com orders?
654.063,654.263,No.
654.643,655.343,Bank records?
656.044,656.244,No.
656.464,659.986,What judicial consent is required for NSA?
