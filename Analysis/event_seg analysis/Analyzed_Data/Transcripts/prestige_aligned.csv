2.277,4.518, Olivia means nothing.
4.838,5.878,I need an assistant.
6.099,7.419,I can't not have an assistant.
7.639,9.24,I'll tell her I know what you... You'll tell her what?
9.42,11.621,"I know what you really are, Alfred."
11.641,13.821,"I know, I know."
13.881,15.682,"Sarah, Sarah, Sarah."
16.202,17.223,You can't talk like this.
17.643,18.423,"Sarah, shut up."
18.903,20.044,"Sarah, shut up!"
20.364,21.664,I don't want to hear it anymore!
21.984,23.725,You can't talk like this!
33.526,35.627, I can't live like this.
35.987,37.687,"Oh, you think I can live like this?"
38.107,41.308,You think I'd bloody enjoy living like this?
41.328,41.869,Stop it!
41.969,42.989,I can't live like this!
43.029,45.27,"Well, what do you want from me?"
45.41,45.43,I...
56.98,61.443, I want... I want you to be honest with me.
64.364,65.045,No tricks.
66.886,68.707,No lies.
68.847,72.269,And no secrets.
79.933,80.773,Do you love me?
84.756,85.196,Not today.
97.682,98.723, Thank you.
140.859,143.562, Thank you.
183.154,183.795, Who's there?
187.257,188.438,I'm looking for an old friend.
189.139,190.079,I heard about a booking.
190.84,191.781,Nice little theater.
192.001,193.182,Good up-and-coming magician.
193.402,193.902,You're back.
194.703,195.464,"It's good to see you, John."
196.725,197.786,Good rehearsal space.
199.427,200.488,Blind stagehands.
200.548,201.088,I like it.
202.069,204.131,You always had a good eye for publicity.
204.651,205.371,"I need your help, John."
206.312,207.093,It's my last show.
207.753,208.574,Eliminate engagement.
209.074,209.755,Your last show?
210.856,213.198, A wise man once told me obsession was a young man's game.
214.379,214.999,I'm almost done.
215.019,217.0,There's one thing left.
218.922,220.523,The real transported man.
223.065,224.786,You want to design a show around it?
224.946,226.107,"Yeah, I don't want you backstage."
226.127,227.348,I need you front of house managing.
227.728,231.511,I need you to call in any favors or connections you have left to get us the right booking for the run.
232.211,233.552,What sort of booking you after?
234.153,235.434,The sort that Borden can't ignore.
244.15,246.031," What an honor it is to see you again, sir."
246.071,247.952,You told me you only wanted to show me one trick.
247.992,249.032,It piqued my interest.
249.253,251.094,"It's a very clever trick, Mr. Ackerman."
251.414,252.334,"Pleased to meet you, Mr. Ackerman."
252.634,253.535,"Likewise, I'm sure."
253.555,258.937,"Well, let's get on, shall we?"
258.957,259.718,"Turn it on, gentlemen."
265.481,265.961,Very pretty.
277.219,277.94," That's it, Carter."
278.34,279.481,He simply disappears.
280.742,281.502,That's not a trick.
282.163,283.083,But he has to come back.
283.624,284.845,There has to be a... A prestige.
284.885,285.385,Exactly.
289.168,289.648,Pardon me.
291.649,295.492,It's very rare to see real magic.
297.874,299.615,It's been many years since I've seen it.
299.635,300.636,Are you interested in helping us?
303.138,303.358,Yes.
305.099,306.24,But you'll have to dress it up a little.
308.891,309.471, Disguise it.
312.052,313.552,Give them enough reason to doubt it.
315.273,317.574,"You haven't spoken about her, Freddy, not once."
317.594,320.695,Why would I talk about her to you?
321.335,323.456,Because she was a part of your life.
323.476,325.256,And now she's gone.
326.476,331.358,"You know, the day before she killed herself, she said she wanted to meet me."
331.378,334.339,That she had something to tell me about you.
334.359,337.92,"I was such a coward, I couldn't bring myself to face her."
342.344,343.205, What would she have said?
344.327,345.868,You want to know the truth about me?
346.369,354.719,The truth is that I never loved Ciara.
355.24,357.082,I never loved her.
357.303,358.264,You married her.
358.344,359.585,You had a child with her.
